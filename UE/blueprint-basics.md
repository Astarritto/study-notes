Class : A code file which contains various data and functions
Class inheritance is used to "easily reuse" specific functions. 
Derived class has additional parts from the Base class, so that we could easily create some class just bit more than the Base class
(DerivedClass = BaseClass + a)
{
ACTOR
base class for all objects in the world, static or movable, doesn't move, like lighting, walls etc., 

PAWN
moving object, not fixed, controlable(by player or ai), inheritaned from ACTOR

CHARACTOR
inheritaned by PAWN(ofcourse this means charactor inheritaned from ACTOR too)
pawn with built-in movement features(humanoid or animal-like, walking jumping...)
}

Multiple inheritance should be avoided (inheritaned from more than 1 class)
**inheritance chain(A>B>C) != multiple inheritance(A,B>C)

Instance = copied blueprint object(in level), generated by the blueprint

Difference between instance blueprint - original blueprint
If you edit the original blueprint, it will affect instance blueprint.
But if you edit the instance blueprint, original blueprint woule not be affected.

{
Event Begin Play
Called when the game starts or when the actor is spawned
once when it begins, initialize

Event ActorBeginOverlap
Called when another begins to overlap with this actor(with collision enabled)
when collision happens, trigger, interaction

Event Tick
Called every frame (once per frame)
continuous monitoring(real-time check), moving
}


Variable isn't recognized by the computer and impossible to put number in it until you compile it!!
variable instance Editable (v)

ctrl + variable drag and drop = Get
alt + variable drag and drop = Set

(Don't forget to Compile & Save)

input -> node function -> output

parameter = temporarily generated variable to operate specific function
